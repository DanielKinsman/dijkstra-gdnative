# Dijkstra flow GDNative

A GDNative library for computing shortest path trees using Dijkstra's algorithm, and using them to compute flow fields for navigation.

Similar to [this][1] but using Dijkstra's algortih supporting different edge weights instead of using breadth first search with the same weight for all edges.
